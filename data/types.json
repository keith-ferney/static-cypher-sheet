        "description": "\nFantasy/Fairy tale:\n    Warrior, fighter, swordsman, knight, barbarian,\n    soldier, myrmidon, valkyrie\n\nModern/Horror/Romance:\n    police officer, soldier, watchman, detective,\n    guard, brawler, tough, athlete\n\nScience fiction:\n    security officer, warrior, trooper, soldier, merc\n\nSuperhero/Post-Apocalyptic:\n    hero, brick, bruiser\n\nYou\u2019re a good ally to have in a fight. You know how to use weapons and\ndefend yourself. Depending on the genre and setting in question, this\nmight mean wielding a sword and shield in the gladiatorial arena, an\nAK-47 and a bandolier of grenades in a savage firefight, or a blaster\nrifle and powered armor when exploring an alien planet.\n\n    Individual Role:\n    Warriors are physical,\n    action-oriented people. They\u2019re more likely to overcome a challenge\n    using force than by other means, and they often take the most\n    straightforward path toward their goals.\n\n    Group Role:\n    Warriors usually take and deal the most punishment in a\n    dangerous situation. Often it falls on them to protect the other group\n    members from threats. This sometimes means that warriors take on\n    leadership roles as well, at least in combat and other times of danger.\n\n    Societal Role:\n    Warriors aren\u2019t always soldiers or mercenaries. Anyone\n    who is ready for violence, or even potential violence, might be a\n    Warrior in the general sense. This includes guards, watchmen, police\n    officers, sailors, or people in other roles or professions who know how\n    to defend themselves with skill.\n\n    Advanced Warriors:\n    As warriors advance, their skill in battle\u2014whether\n    defending themselves or dishing out damage\u2014increases to impressive\n    levels. At higher tiers, they can often take on groups of foes by\n    themselves or stand toe to toe with anyone.\n\n    Warrior Background Connection\n    -----------------------------\n\nYour type helps determine the connection you have to the setting. Roll a\nd20 or choose from the following list to determine a specific fact about\nyour background that provides a connection to the rest of the world.

Make a\n    separate attack roll for each foe. You remain limited by the amount of\n    Effort you can apply on one action.\n\n    Old Friend:\n    A comrade in arms from your past shows up unexpectedly and\n    provides aid in whatever you\u2019re doing. They are on a mission of their\n    own and can\u2019t stay longer than it takes to help out, chat for a while\n    after, and perhaps share a quick meal.\n\n    Weapon Break:\n    Your foe\u2019s weapon has a weak spot.

This is sometimes the best way to ensure that you have\nexactly the character you want. This is particularly true with abilities\nthat grant skills, which can usually be taken multiple times.)\n\nSixth-Tier Warrior\n    ------------------\n\n    Choose two of the abilities listed below (or from a lower tier) to add\nto your repertoire. In addition, you can replace one of your lower-tier\nabilities with a different one from a lower tier.\n\n* :ref:`Again and Again <Again and Again>`\n    * :ref:`Finishing Blow <Finishing Blow>`\n    * :ref:`Magnificent Moment <Magnificent Moment>`\n    * :ref:`Murderer <Murderer>`\n    * :ref:`Spin Attack <Spin Attack>`\n    * :ref:`Weapon and Body <Weapon and Body>`\n\nWarrior Example\n    ---------------\n\nRay wants to create a Warrior character for a modern campaign. He\n    decides that the character is an ex-military fellow who is fast and\n    strong. He puts 3 of his additional points into his Might Pool and 3\ninto his Speed Pool; his stat Pools are now Might 13, Speed 13, and\nIntellect 8. As a first-tier character, his Effort is 1, his Might Edge\nis 1, and his Speed Edge and Intellect Edge are both 0. His character is\nnot particularly smart or charismatic.\n\n    He wants to use a large combat knife (a medium weapon that inflicts 4\npoints of damage) and a .357 Magnum (a heavy pistol that inflicts 6\npoints of damage but requires the use of both hands). Ray decides not to\nwear armor, as it\u2019s not really appropriate to the setting, so for his\n                                                                  first ability, he chooses :ref:`Trained Without Armor <Trained Without Armor>` so he eases Speed\ndefense actions. For his second ability, he chooses\n    :ref:`Combat Prowess <Combat Prowess>` so he\ncan inflict extra damage with his big knife.\n\n    Ray wants to be fast as well as tough, so he selects :ref:`Improved Edge <Improved Edge>`. This\ngives him a Speed Edge of 1. He rounds out his character with\n    :ref:`Physical Skills <Physical Skills>` and chooses swimming and running.\n\n    The Warrior can bear two cyphers. The GM decides that Ray\u2019s first cypher\nis a pill that restores 6 points of Might when swallowed, and his second\nis a small, easily concealed grenade that explodes like a firebomb when\nthrown, inflicting 3 points of damage to all within immediate range.\n\n    Ray still needs to choose a descriptor and a focus. Looking ahead to the\ndescriptor rules, Ray chooses :ref:`descriptor:Strong`, which increases his Might Pool to\n17. He also becomes trained in jumping and breaking inanimate objects.\n    (If he had chosen jumping as one of his physical skills, the Strong\ndescriptor would have made him specialized in jumping instead of\ntrained.) Being Strong also gives Ray an extra medium or heavy weapon.\n    He chooses a baseball bat that he\u2019ll use in a pinch. He keeps it in the\ntrunk of his car.\n\nFor his focus, Ray chooses :ref:`focus:Masters Weaponry`. This gives him yet another\nweapon of high quality. He chooses another combat knife and asks the GM\nif he could use it in his left hand\u2014not to make attacks, but as a\nshield. This will ease his Speed defense rolls if he has both knives out\n    (the \u201cshield\u201d counts as an asset). The GM agrees. During the game, Ray\u2019s\nWarrior will be hard to hit\u2014he is trained in Speed defense rolls, and\nhis extra knife eases his defense rolls by another step.\n\n    Thanks to his focus, he also inflicts 1 additional point of damage with\nhis chosen weapon. Now he inflicts 6 points of damage with his blade.\n    Ray\u2019s character is a deadly combatant, likely starting the game with a\nreputation as a knife fighter.\n\nFor his character arc, Ray chooses :ref:`experience-points:Defeat a Foe`.\n    That foe, he decides,\nis none other than someone in his company who was once a friend but went\nrogue.\n\n"

They might be magic, psychic powers,\nmutant abilities, or just a wide variety of intricate devices, depending\non the setting. (\u201cMagic\u201d here is a term used very loosely. It\u2019s a\ncatch-all for the kinds of wondrous, possibly supernatural things that\nyour character can do that others cannot. It might actually be an\nexpression of technological devices, channeling spirits, mutations,\npsionics, nanotechnology, or any number of other sources.)\n\nIndividual Role:\n    Adepts are usually thoughtful, intelligent types. They\n    often think carefully before acting and rely heavily on their\n    supernatural abilities.\n\n    Group Role:\n    Adepts are not powerful in straightforward combat, although\n    they often wield abilities that provide excellent combat support, both\n    offensively and defensively. They sometimes possess abilities that\n    facilitate overcoming challenges. For example, if the group must get\n    through a locked door, an Adept might be able to destroy it or teleport\n    everyone to the other side.\n\n    Societal Role:\n    In settings where the supernatural is rare, strange, or\n    feared, Adepts are likely rare and feared as well. They remain hidden,\n    shadowy figures. When this is not the case, Adepts are more likely to be\n    common and forthright. They might even take leadership roles.\n\n    Advanced Adepts:\n    Even at low tiers, Adept powers are impressive.\n    Higher-tier Adepts can accomplish amazing deeds that can reshape matter\n    and the environment around them.\n\n    (Adepts are almost always emblematic of the paranormal or superhuman in\nsome way\u2014wizards, psychics, or something similar. If the game you\u2019re\nplaying has none of that, an Adept could be a charlatan mimicking such\nabilities with tricks and hidden devices, or a gadgeteer character with\na \u201cutility belt\u201d full of oddments. Or a game like that might not have\nAdepts. That\u2019s okay too.)\n\nAdept Player Intrusions\n    -----------------------\n\nWhen playing an Adept, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following\nplayer intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM\nagrees.\n\nAdvantageous Malfunction:\n    A device being used against you malfunctions.\n    It might harm the user or one of their allies for a round, or activate a\n    dramatic and distracting side effect for a few rounds.\n\n    Convenient Idea:\n    A flash of insight provides you with a clear answer or\n    suggests a course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem,\n    or obstacle you\u2019re facing.\n\n    Inexplicably Unbroken:\n    An inactive, ruined, or presumed-destroyed device\n    temporarily activates and performs a useful function relevant to the\n    situation. This is enough to buy you some time for a better solution,\n                                                       alleviate a complication that was interfering with your abilities, or\n    just get you one more use out of a depleted cypher or artifact.\n\n    Adept Stat Pools\n    ----------------\n\n========= ===================\nStat      Pool Starting Value\n    ========= ===================\nMight     7\nSpeed     9\nIntellect 12\n    ========= ===================\n\nYou get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you\nwish.\n\nAdept Background Connection\n    ---------------------------\n\nYour type helps determine the connection you have to the setting.

She\n    decides to be somewhat well rounded, so she puts 2 of her additional\npoints into each stat Pool, giving her a Might Pool of 9, a Speed Pool\nof 11, and an Intellect Pool of 14. Her Adept is smart and quick. She\nhas an Intellect Edge of 1, a Might Edge of 0, and a Speed Edge of 0. As\na first-tier character, her Effort is 1. As her initial abilities, she\nchooses :ref:`Onslaught <Onslaught>` and :ref:`Ward <Ward>`, giving her a strong offense and defense. She\nalso chooses :ref:`Magic Training <Magic Training>` and rounds out her character with :ref:`Scan <Scan>`,\nwhich she hopes will be useful in gaining insight and information. For\n        this character, Onslaught, Ward, and Scan are all spells she has\nmastered through years of training and study.\n\n    She can bear three cyphers. The GM gives her a potion that acts as a\nshort-range teleporter, a small charm that restores 5 points to her\nIntellect Pool, and a fluid-filled flask that explodes like a fiery\nbomb. Jen\u2019s sorcerer is skilled with light weapons, so she chooses a\ndagger.\n\nFor her descriptor, Jen chooses :ref:`descriptor:Graceful`, which adds 2 points to her\nSpeed Pool, bringing it to 13. That descriptor means she is trained in\nbalancing and anything requiring careful movements, physical performing\narts, and Speed defense tasks. Perhaps she is a dancer. In fact, she\nbegins to develop a backstory that involves graceful, lithe movements\nthat she incorporates into her spells.\n\nFor her focus, she chooses :ref:`focus:Leads`. This gives her training in social\ninteractions, which again helps round her out\u2014she\u2019s good in all kinds of\nsituations. Moreover, she has the :ref:`Good Advice <Good Advice>` ability, which enables her\nto be a focal point of her group.\n\n    Her spells and focus abilities cost Intellect points to activate, so\nshe\u2019s glad to have a lot of points in her Intellect Pool. In addition,\nher Intellect Edge will help reduce those costs. If she uses her\n    :ref:`Onslaught <Onslaught>` force blast without applying Effort, it costs 0 Intellect\npoints and deals 4 points of damage. Her Intellect Edge will allow her\nto save points to devote toward applying Effort for other purposes,\n                                                    perhaps to boost the accuracy of Onslaught.\n\nFor her character arc, Jen chooses :ref:`experience-points:Aid a Friend`. She decides that when\nher sorcerer character was young, she had a magical mentor. That mentor\nwas later taken prisoner by a demon, so her character is always looking\nfor clues on how to find the demon and release her friend from bondage.\n\n    (GMs are always free to pre-select a type\u2019s special abilities at a given\ntier to reinforce the setting. In the fantasy setting of Jen\u2019s sorcerer,\nthe GM might have said that all sorcerers (Adepts) start with\n    :ref:`Magic Training <Magic Training>`\nas one of their tier 1 abilities. This doesn\u2019t make the\ncharacter any less powerful or special, but it says something about her\nrole in the world and expectations in the game.)\n\n"

You travel to strange, exotic, and dangerous places, and\ndiscover new things. This means you\u2019re physical but also probably\nknowledgeable.\n\nIndividual Role:\n    Although Explorers can be academics or well studied,\n    they are first and foremost interested in action. They face grave\n    dangers and terrible obstacles as a routine part of life.\n\n    Group Role:\n    Explorers sometimes work alone, but far more often they\n    operate in teams with other characters. The Explorer frequently leads\n    the way, blazing the trail. However, they\u2019re also likely to stop and\n    investigate anything intriguing they stumble upon.\n\n    Societal Role:\n    Not all Explorers are out traipsing through the\n    wilderness or poking about an old ruin. Sometimes, an Explorer is a\n    teacher, a scientist, a detective, or an investigative reporter. In any\n    event, an Explorer bravely faces new challenges and gathers knowledge to\n    share with others.\n\n    Advanced Explorers:\n    Higher-tier Explorers gain more skills, some combat\n    abilities, and a number of abilities that allow them to deal with\n    danger. In short, they become more and more well-rounded, able to deal\n    with any challenge.\n\n    Explorer Player Intrusions\n    --------------------------\n\n    When playing an Explorer, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following\nplayer intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM\nagrees.\n\nFortuitous Malfunction:\n    A trap or a dangerous device malfunctions before\n    it can affect you.\n\n    Serendipitous Landmark:\n    Just when it seems like the path is lost (or you\n    are), a trail marker, a landmark, or simply the way the terrain or\n    corridor bends, rises, or falls away suggests to you the best path\n    forward, at least from this point.\n\n    Weak Strain:\n    The poison or disease turns out not to be as debilitating\n    or deadly as it first seemed, and inflicts only half the damage that it\n    would have otherwise.\n\n    Explorer Stat Pools\n    -------------------\n\n========= ===================\nStat      Pool Starting Value\n    ========= ===================\nMight     10\nSpeed     9\nIntellect 9\n    ========= ===================\n\nYou get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you\nwish.\n\nExplorer Background Connection\n    ------------------------------\n\n    Your type helps determine the connection you have to the setting.

This character will be a hardy soul who explores alien worlds.\n    They put 3 additional points into their Might Pool, 2 into their Speed\nPool, and 1 into their Intellect Pool; their stat Pools are now Might\n13, Speed 11, and Intellect 10. As a first-tier character, their Effort\nis 1, their Might Edge is 1, and their Speed Edge and Intellect Edge are\n0. Their character is fairly well-rounded so far.\n\n    Sam immediately leaps in and starts choosing abilities. They pick\n    :ref:`Danger Sense <Danger Sense>` and :ref:`Surging Confidence <Surging Confidence>`, thinking those abilities will be generally\nuseful. They also choose :ref:`Practiced in Armor <Practiced in Armor>`,\nreasoning that the\ncharacter wears high-tech medium armor when exploring. Last, they choose\n    :ref:`Knowledge Skills <Knowledge Skills>` and select geology and biology to help during\ninterplanetary explorations.\n\n    Sam\u2019s Explorer can bear two cyphers, which in this setting involve\nnanotechnology. The GM decides that one is a nanite injector that grants\na +1 bonus to Might Edge when used, and the other is a device that can\ncreate one simple handheld object the user wishes.\n\n    Sam\u2019s Explorer is not really geared toward fighting, but sometimes the\nuniverse is a dangerous place, so they note that they\u2019re carrying a\nmedium blaster as well.\n\n    Sam still needs a descriptor and a focus. Looking to the Descriptor\nchapter, they choose :ref:`descriptor:Hardy`, which increases their Might Pool to 17. They\nalso heal more quickly and can operate better when injured. They\u2019re\ntrained in Might defense but have an inability with initiative; however,\nit\u2019s effectively canceled out by their Danger Sense (and vice versa).\nSam could go back and select something else instead of Danger Sense, but\nthey like it and decide to keep it. Overall, the descriptor ends up\nmaking the character tough but a little slow.\n\nFor their focus, Sam chooses :ref:`focus:Explores Dark Places`\n(in this case, weird\nruins of alien civilizations). This gives the character a bunch of\nadditional skills: searching, listening, climbing, balancing, and\njumping. They\u2019re quite the capable Explorer.\n\nFor their character arc, Sam chooses :ref:`experience-points:Enterprise`. Exploring alien places\nsometimes turns up strange relics, and Sam figures they might be able to\nset up a service to reliably transport these items to responsible third\nparties, rather than allow them to fall into the hands of pirates and\n    rich private collectors. For a small fee, of course.\n\n"

You talk your way past\nchallenges and out of jams, and you get people to do what you want.\n\n    Individual Role:\n    Speakers are smart and charismatic. They like people\n    and, more important, they understand them. This helps speakers get\n    others to do what needs to be done.\n\n    Group Role:\n    The Speaker is often the face of the group, serving as the\n    person who speaks for all and negotiates with others. Combat and action\n    are not a Speaker\u2019s strong suits, so other characters sometimes have to\n    defend the Speaker in times of danger.\n\n    Societal Role:\n    Speakers are frequently political or religious leaders.\n    Just as often, however, they are con artists or criminals.\n\n    Advanced Speakers:\n    Higher-tier speakers use their abilities to control\n    and manipulate people as well as aid and nurture their friends. They can\n    talk their way out of danger and even use their words as weapons.\n\n    Speaker Player Intrusions\n    -------------------------\n\nWhen playing a Speaker, you can spend 1 XP to use one of the following\nplayer intrusions, provided the situation is appropriate and the GM\nagrees.\n\nFriendly NPC:\n    An NPC you don\u2019t know, someone you don\u2019t know that well,\n    or someone you know but who hasn\u2019t been particularly friendly in the\n    past chooses to help you, though doesn\u2019t necessarily explain why. Maybe\n    they\u2019ll ask you for a favor in return afterward, depending on how much\n    trouble they go to.\n\n    Perfect Suggestion:\n    A follower or other already-friendly NPC suggests a\n    course of action with regard to an urgent question, problem, or obstacle\n    you\u2019re facing.\n\n    Unexpected Gift:\n    An NPC hands you a physical gift you were not\n    expecting, one that helps put the situation at ease if things seem\n    strained, or provides you with a new insight for understanding the\n                                                     context of the situation if there\u2019s something you\u2019re failing to\n    understand or grasp.\n\n    Speaker Stat Pools\n    ------------------\n\n========= ===================\nStat      Pool Starting Value\n    ========= ===================\nMight     8\nSpeed     9\nIntellect 11\n    ========= ===================\n\nYou get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you\nwish.\n\nSpeaker Background Connection\n    -----------------------------\n\nYour type helps determine the connection you have to the setting.

She\nputs 3 of her additional stat points into her Intellect Pool and 3 into\nher Speed Pool; her stat Pools are now Might 8, Speed 12, and Intellect\n14. As a first-tier character, her Effort is 1, her Might Edge and Speed\nEdge are 0, and her Intellect Edge is 1. She\u2019s smart and charismatic but\nnot particularly tough.\n\n    Mary chooses :ref:`Fast Talk <Fast Talk>` and :ref:`Spin Identity <Spin Identity>` to help get into places and\n    learn things she wants to know. She\u2019s a bit of a con artist. She\u2019s good\nto her friends, however, and chooses :ref:`Encouragement <Encouragement>` as well. Mary rounds\nout her first-tier abilities with :ref:`Interaction Skills <Interaction Skills>` (deceiving and\n        persuasion).\n\n    A Speaker normally starts with two cyphers, but the GM rules that\ncharacters in this campaign start with only one\u2014something creepy\nrelating to their background. Mary\u2019s cypher is an odd pocket watch given\nto her by her grandfather. She doesn\u2019t know how or why, but when\nactivated, the watch allows her to take twice as many actions for three\n                                                                  rounds.\n\n                                                                  Mary\u2019s character carries a small knife hidden in her bag in case of\ntrouble. As a light weapon, it inflicts 2 points of damage, but attacks\nwith it are eased.\n\n    Mary chooses :ref:`descriptor:Resilient` for her descriptor and decides that she can\nprobably learn the truth behind some of the strange things that she\u2019s\nheard about without feeling too much trauma if it\u2019s horrible. Resilient\nincreases her Might Pool to 10 and her Intellect Pool to 16. She\u2019s\ntrained in Might and Intellect defense actions and gains an extra\nrecovery roll each day. At first, Mary is sad that her descriptor gives\nher an inability in knowledge and puzzle tasks, but then she realizes\nthat the flaw fits her character well\u2014she\u2019s better at getting people to\ntell her what she needs to know than at figuring out the information\nherself.\n\nFor her focus, Mary chooses :ref:`focus:Moves Like a Cat`, granting her a final Speed\n    Pool of 18 and training in balance. In the end, she\u2019s graceful and\n    quick, charismatic, and hardier than she initially thought thanks to her\ndrive. She\u2019s ready to investigate the weird.\n\nFor her character arc, Mary chooses :ref:`experience-points:Fall From Grace`. She decides she\u2019s\nhad an obsession with a strange tome that\u2019s been in her family for\n        generations, and her character is drawn to its strange languages and\n    rituals.\n"
